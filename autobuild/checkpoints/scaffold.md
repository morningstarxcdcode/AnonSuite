# Scaffolding Phase Checkpoint

This checkpoint marks the completion of the scaffolding phase for AnonSuite. The project structure has been reviewed and enhanced to ensure consistency and adherence to best practices.

Key actions performed:
- Verified the existence and content of `.gitignore`.
- Created a root `.editorconfig` for consistent coding styles.
- Confirmed the comprehensive configuration of `pyproject.toml` for dependency management, linting (`ruff`), type-checking (`mypy`), and testing (`pytest`).
- Populated previously empty directories (`docs/`, `infra/`, `run/`, `seed/`, `tests/`) with `README.md` files explaining their intended purpose.
- Added `__init__.py` and a `test_placeholder.py` to the `tests/` directory to ensure the test suite is properly initialized and discoverable.

This phase has established a solid foundation for further development, addressing initial structural issues and preparing the project for the implementation of fixes and new features.
