# Design Phase Checkpoint

This checkpoint marks the completion of the initial system design documentation for AnonSuite. The `docs/architecture.md` file has been created, outlining the project's core components, structure, data flow, UI/UX, observability, deployment, and security model.

Key aspects covered:
- Identification of core technologies (Python, Tor, Polipo, Privoxy, HAProxy, Pixiewps, Wifipumpkin3).
- Overview of module responsibilities and interaction with external tools.
- Analysis of configuration management and logging.
- Initial assessment of the security model and potential vulnerabilities.
- Definition of the desired high-level, complex, and functional testing strategy.

This document serves as a foundational understanding of the existing system, which will guide the subsequent implementation and refinement phases, particularly in addressing the identified errors and warnings, and making empty directories useful.
