  "todos": [
    "Verify multitor functionality after core fixes.",
    "Ensure tests are high-level, complex, and functional, covering core anonymity and security features.",
    "Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) for linting, type-checking, testing, and building.",
    "Improve project documentation (README, docs/architecture.md, etc.).",
    "Refine code style and structure for human-coded authenticity."
  ],
  "errors_found": [
    "Log warnings: polipo not found in PATH, privoxy not found in PATH (awaiting user installation)",
    "Log errors: HAProxy config file not found, HAProxy failed to start (awaiting user installation and verification of fixes)"
  ],
  "uniqueness_angle": "AnonSuite's strength lies in its integration of multiple anonymity and network security tools into a single, modular, CLI-based solution, providing multi-layered protection. The goal is to achieve a 'human-coded' feel through idiomatic Python, clear architecture, and robust, high-level functional tests."
