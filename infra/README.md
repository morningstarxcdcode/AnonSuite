This directory is intended for infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scripts, deployment configurations, or related files for setting up and managing the AnonSuite environment.

Examples might include:
- Terraform configurations
- Ansible playbooks
- Docker Compose files (though `wifipumpkin3` has one in its own directory)
- Cloud deployment scripts
