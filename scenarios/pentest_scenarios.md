# Realistic Penetration Testing Scenarios

These scenarios are based on actual penetration testing engagements (anonymized, of course). Use these to test AnonSuite functionality in realistic contexts.

## Scenario 1: Corporate WiFi Assessment

**Background**: Mid-size tech company (200 employees) wants to test their guest WiFi security before a major conference.

**Network Details**:
- Main corporate network: "TechCorp-Secure" (WPA2-Enterprise)
- Guest network: "TechCorp-Guest" (WPA2-PSK, password rotated monthly)
- Legacy printer network: "TechCorp-Printers" (WEP, unfortunately still in use)
- Executive floor: "TechCorp-Exec" (WPA3, hidden SSID)

**Testing Objectives**:
1. Verify guest network isolation from corporate network
2. Test WPS vulnerability on older access points
3. Check for rogue access points
4. Assess password complexity on guest network

**Expected Findings**:
- Guest network properly isolated âœ“
- One legacy AP with WPS enabled (printer network)
- Weak guest password: "Welcome2024!"
- No rogue APs detected

**AnonSuite Usage**:
```bash
# Start anonymity layer
sudo anonsuite
# Select: Anonymity -> Start AnonSuite

# Scan for networks
sudo anonsuite
# Select: WiFi Auditing -> Scan for Networks

# Test WPS on printer network
sudo anonsuite  
# Select: WiFi Auditing -> Pixie-Dust Attack
# Target: TechCorp-Printers (BSSID: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)
```

## Scenario 2: Coffee Shop Security Assessment

**Background**: Local coffee chain wants to ensure their free WiFi isn't being abused or compromised.

**Network Details**:
- Public WiFi: "CoffeePlus-Free" (Open network with captive portal)
- Staff network: "CoffeePlus-Staff" (WPA2-PSK)
- POS system: "CoffeePlus-POS" (Hidden, WPA2-Enterprise)

**Common Issues Found**:
- Customers creating rogue hotspots with similar names
- Weak staff network password
- Unencrypted traffic on public network

**Testing Approach**:
1. Monitor for rogue access points
2. Test captive portal bypass techniques
3. Analyze traffic patterns for suspicious activity

## Scenario 3: Home Office Security Review

**Background**: Remote worker wants to secure their home office setup before handling sensitive client data.

**Network Details**:
- Main home network: "HomeNetwork_5G" (WPA2)
- IoT devices: "SmartHome" (WPA2, separate VLAN)
- Guest network: "Visitors" (WPA2, limited access)

**Security Concerns**:
- Default router credentials
- Outdated firmware
- Weak WiFi passwords
- Unsecured IoT devices

**Testing Process**:
1. Verify network segmentation
2. Test for default credentials
3. Check for firmware vulnerabilities
4. Assess password strength

## Scenario 4: Conference/Event Security

**Background**: Large cybersecurity conference (1000+ attendees) needs to ensure their WiFi infrastructure can't be compromised during the event.

**Network Details**:
- Attendee WiFi: "CyberCon2024" (WPA2-PSK, daily password rotation)
- Speaker network: "CyberCon-Speakers" (WPA2-Enterprise)
- Vendor network: "CyberCon-Vendors" (Isolated VLAN)
- Staff network: "CyberCon-Staff" (WPA3)

**Unique Challenges**:
- High-skill attendees (security professionals)
- Multiple competing networks in area
- Potential for sophisticated attacks
- Need for real-time monitoring

**Red Team Objectives**:
1. Attempt to create convincing rogue AP
2. Test for evil twin attacks
3. Monitor for deauth attacks
4. Assess network monitoring capabilities

## Scenario 5: Small Business Assessment

**Background**: Local accounting firm (15 employees) needs security assessment for compliance requirements.

**Network Details**:
- Business network: "AccountingFirm" (WPA2)
- Client WiFi: "AF-Clients" (WPA2, limited internet access)
- Backup connection: "AF-Backup" (4G hotspot, WPA2)

**Compliance Requirements**:
- PCI DSS (they process payments)
- SOX compliance (some public company clients)
- State privacy regulations

**Testing Focus**:
1. Network segmentation verification
2. Access control testing
3. Data encryption validation
4. Incident response procedures

## Testing Notes & Tips

### Common WiFi Vulnerabilities to Test:
- WPS PIN attacks (especially on older routers)
- Weak WPA2 passwords (dictionary attacks)
- Evil twin attacks
- Deauthentication attacks
- Captive portal bypasses

### AnonSuite Best Practices:
1. Always start with anonymity layer active
2. Document all findings with timestamps
3. Use realistic attack scenarios
4. Test during different times of day
5. Monitor for defensive responses

### Legal & Ethical Considerations:
- Always get written permission before testing
- Stay within scope of engagement
- Document all activities
- Report findings promptly
- Suggest remediation steps

### Sample Test Data Files:
- `wordlists/common_passwords.txt` - Common WiFi passwords
- `wordlists/corporate_ssids.txt` - Typical corporate network names
- `wordlists/wps_pins.txt` - Common WPS PINs

### Performance Benchmarks:
- Network scan: < 30 seconds for typical environment
- WPS attack: 2-10 minutes depending on target
- Rogue AP detection: Continuous monitoring
- Anonymity layer startup: < 15 seconds
