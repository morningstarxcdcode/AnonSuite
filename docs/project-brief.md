# Project Brief: AnonSuite

## 1. Overview
AnonSuite is envisioned as a robust command-line interface (CLI) toolkit designed to empower users with enhanced online anonymity and security. It aims to consolidate and orchestrate various open-source tools, providing a multi-layered approach to traffic obfuscation, secure browsing, and network security auditing. The project prioritizes a modular architecture for extensibility and a user-friendly CLI experience, all while maintaining a 'human-coded' aesthetic in its development.

## 2. Interpreted Requirements

### 2.1. Project Type
CLI Tool: The primary interaction model will be through the command line, offering powerful functionalities without a graphical interface.

### 2.2. Complexity Level
Production-Ready: The project aims for stability, reliability, and maintainability suitable for real-world use, not just a prototype.

### 2.3. Target Audience
Individual Users: Privacy-conscious individuals seeking tools for online anonymity.
Privacy Professionals: Experts who can leverage advanced features for their work.
Developers: Those interested in extending or contributing to the toolkit.

### 2.4. Technical Requirements
Performance: Efficient proxy chaining and low latency are critical for effective anonymity and a smooth user experience.
Security: Robust traffic obfuscation, secure configuration management, and protection of user data are paramount.
Scalability: The modular design should allow for easy integration of new tools and features in the future.
Offline Capabilities: The primary functionalities should be executable locally without constant internet connectivity (though Tor requires it).

## 3. Core Features (MVP & Future Roadmap)

### 3.1. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

#### 3.1.1. Stabilized Multitor Component:
-   **Goal:** Ensure the `multitor` script reliably launches and manages Tor processes and proxy chains (Privoxy, HAProxy) without errors.
-   **Key Tasks:**
    -   Resolve Tor data directory ownership issues (ensure proper permissions for the user running Tor).
    -   Address Privoxy port binding conflicts (allow dynamic port selection or robust conflict resolution).
    -   Confirm all external binaries (`pidof`, `tor`, `privoxy`, `haproxy`) are correctly located and executed via absolute paths.
    -   Verify consistent and effective logging for all `multitor` operations.

#### 3.1.2. Basic CLI Integration (`anonsuite.py`):
-   **Goal:** Provide a foundational Python CLI entry point to trigger `multitor` functionalities.
-   **Key Tasks:**
    -   Implement basic argument parsing for `anonsuite.py` to pass parameters to `multitor`.
    -   Ensure `anonsuite.py` can execute `multitor` and capture its output/logs.

### 3.2. Future Roadmap

#### 3.2.1. Enhanced Anonymity Features:
-   Support for more proxy types (e.g., Polipo, SOCKS5 proxies).
-   Advanced proxy chaining configurations (e.g., N-hop chains).
-   Traffic analysis countermeasures.

#### 3.2.2. Network Security Auditing Integration:
-   Full integration of `pixiewps` and `wifipumpkin3` functionalities into the `anonsuite.py` CLI.
-   User-friendly interfaces for initiating and managing WiFi attacks/audits.

#### 3.2.3. Robust Testing Framework:
-   Develop comprehensive unit, integration, and functional tests using `pytest`.
-   Achieve high test coverage for core logic and critical paths.

#### 3.2.4. CI/CD Pipeline:
-   Implement GitHub Actions for automated linting (`ruff`), type-checking (`mypy`), and testing (`pytest`).
-   Ensure continuous integration and code quality.

#### 3.2.5. Comprehensive Documentation:
-   Expand `README.md` with detailed installation, usage, and development guides.
-   Create dedicated documentation in the `docs/` directory for advanced topics, contributing guidelines, and architectural decisions.

#### 3.2.6. User Experience & Error Handling:
-   Improve user-facing error messages and provide actionable suggestions.
-   Implement more graceful handling of external tool failures.

#### 3.2.7. Security Hardening:
-   Conduct a thorough security audit of the entire codebase and configurations.
-   Implement additional security best practices (e.g., input validation, secure defaults).

## 4. Human-Coded Aesthetic & Philosophy
As Marcus, the seasoned full-stack architect, the development of AnonSuite will reflect a pragmatic yet thoughtful approach. Code will exhibit natural human characteristics, including:
-   **Variable Naming:** A mix of verbose and concise names, reflecting real-world coding habits.
-   **Comment Authenticity:** Inclusion of `TODO`s, brief explanations, and occasional self-reflection or context-referencing comments.
-   **Code Structure:** Natural function organization, iterative development patterns, and subtle formatting variations.
-   **Dependency Choices:** Preference for solid, widely-adopted libraries, with clear rationale for technical decisions.
-   **Error Handling:** Consistent and helpful error messages, designed for both user clarity and developer debugging.
-   **Documentation:** Written with the next developer in mind, providing reasoning behind decisions and practical troubleshooting tips.

This project will evolve iteratively, with each step building upon a stable foundation, ensuring a high-quality, maintainable, and genuinely human-authored codebase.
