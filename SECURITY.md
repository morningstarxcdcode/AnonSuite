## 🛡️ Security Considerations for Users

### Ethical Use Requirements

AnonSuite is designed for **authorized security testing only**. Users must:

- ✅ Obtain explicit written permission before testing any systems
- ✅ Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- ✅ Use only on systems you own or have authorization to test
- ✅ Follow responsible disclosure for any vulnerabilities found
- ❌ Never use for malicious, illegal, or unauthorized activities

### Security Best Practices

When using AnonSuite:

1. **Run in Isolated Environment**
   ```bash
   # Use virtual machines or containers
   docker-compose up anonsuite-dev
   ```

2. **Keep Software Updated**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```

3. **Verify Installation Integrity**
   ```bash
   # Check file hashes and signatures
   python src/anonsuite.py --health-check
   ```

4. **Use Proper Network Isolation**
   - Test only on isolated networks
   - Use VPNs or air-gapped systems when appropriate
   - Avoid testing on production networks

5. **Secure Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Use strong passwords and secure settings
   python src/anonsuite.py --config-wizard
   ```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs are validated and sanitized
   - Command injection prevention
   - Path traversal protection

2. **Privilege Management**
   - Runs with minimal required privileges
   - Clear separation of privileged operations
   - User confirmation for dangerous actions

3. **Data Protection**
   - Sensitive data is not logged
   - Temporary files are securely cleaned up
   - Configuration files have restricted permissions

4. **Network Security**
   - Tor integration for anonymity
   - Encrypted communications where possible
   - DNS leak prevention measures

### Security Auditing

AnonSuite includes automated security scanning:

```bash
# Run security audit
python src/anonsuite.py --security-audit

# Manual security checks
bandit -r src/
safety check
semgrep --config=auto src/
```

## 🚫 Security Limitations

### Known Limitations

1. **Platform Dependencies**
   - Security depends on underlying OS security
   - Some features require elevated privileges
   - Network security depends on proper configuration

2. **Third-Party Components**
   - Integrates with external tools (Tor, Privoxy, etc.)
   - Security depends on these components
   - Regular updates required for all components

3. **User Responsibility**
   - Tool security depends on proper usage
   - Users must follow ethical guidelines
   - Legal compliance is user's responsibility

### Not Suitable For

- ❌ Production network security (use dedicated security appliances)
- ❌ Unauthorized testing or malicious activities
- ❌ High-security environments without proper authorization
- ❌ Compliance-critical applications without additional validation
