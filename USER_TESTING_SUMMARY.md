## Recommendations for Continued Improvement

### Priority 1 (Critical for Production)
1. **Implement Health Check System**
   ```python
   def _run_health_check(self):
       checks = [
           ("Python Version", self._check_python_version),
           ("System Dependencies", self._check_system_deps),
           ("Configuration Files", self._check_config_files),
           ("Network Connectivity", self._check_network)
       ]
       # Implement with timeouts and clear reporting
   ```

2. **Debug Plugin Loading**
   - Investigate why sample_plugin.py doesn't load
   - Add better plugin loading diagnostics
   - Provide clear plugin development examples

### Priority 2 (Enhanced User Experience)

   - Implement airport utility integration
   - Add system_profiler WiFi detection
   - Provide macOS-specific WiFi capabilities

2. **Progress Indicators**
   - Add spinners for long operations
   - Implement progress bars for scans
   - Provide time estimates where possible

### Priority 3 (Advanced Features)
