   - Consider implementing test categories and tags
   - Add more integration test scenarios

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. **Dependency Updates**
   - Monthly security patch reviews
   - Quarterly major version updates
   - Annual dependency audit and cleanup

2. **Security Reviews**
   - Quarterly security assessments
   - Annual penetration testing
   - Continuous vulnerability monitoring

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Regular performance benchmarking
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Network efficiency improvements

## Deployment and Operations

### Production Deployment Checklist
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Security audit clean
- [x] Documentation complete
