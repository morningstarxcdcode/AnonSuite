# AnonSuite Environment Variables and External Dependencies Configuration

# This file documents external dependencies and their expected locations.
# AnonSuite relies on the following binaries being available in the system's PATH,
# or at the absolute paths specified within the multitor scripts.

# --- Core Anonymity Tools ---
# Tor: The Onion Router
# Typically installed via Homebrew on macOS: /opt/homebrew/bin/tor
#
# Privoxy: Web proxy for filtering and forwarding
# Typically installed via Homebrew on macOS: /opt/homebrew/sbin/privoxy
#
# HAProxy: High-performance TCP/HTTP load balancer
# Typically installed via Homebrew on macOS: /opt/homebrew/bin/haproxy
#
# pidof: Utility to find the process ID of a running program
# Typically installed via Homebrew (proctools) on macOS: /opt/homebrew/bin/pidof

# --- User Context for Sudo Operations ---
# The multitor script often runs Tor and proxy processes using 'sudo -u <USER>'.
# Ensure the specified user exists on your system and has necessary permissions.
# Example: USER=your_username

# --- WiFi Auditing Tools (Future Integration) ---
# Pixiewps: For WPS auditing
# Wifipumpkin3: For rogue AP and credential harvesting
# (Installation details for these will be added upon their full integration)

# --- Example Usage (for multitor) ---
# The multitor script expects arguments for user, socks_port, control_port, proxy, and haproxy.
# Example:
# sudo /path/to/multitor --user your_username --socks-port 9000 --control-port 9001 --proxy privoxy --haproxy yes
