# Development Notes - AnonSuite

## 2025-01-12 - Marcus

### Current State Analysis
Just inherited this security toolkit project. Pretty solid foundation but needs some love. The core functionality works but there's definitely room for improvement in the developer experience department.

### What's Working Well
- Core CLI interface is functional
- Test coverage is actually decent (37 tests passing)
- Docker setup looks good
- The anonymity/wifi integration is clever

### Pain Points I've Found
- Some folders are basically empty (what's the point?)
- External deps have linting issues (wifipumpkin3 is messy but functional)
- Missing realistic sample data - current examples are too generic
- No performance monitoring - how do we know if Tor circuits are actually fast?
- Error messages could be more helpful

### TODO (in order of priority)
1. Make every folder actually useful - hate empty directories
2. Add some debugging tools (network latency checker, circuit performance, etc.)
3. Create realistic sample scenarios - not just "test network"
4. Performance monitoring hooks
5. Better error recovery suggestions

### Random Thoughts
- The cyberpunk theme is actually pretty cool, might lean into that more
- Need to add some developer quality-of-life features
- Should probably add a "developer mode" with extra debugging
- The human-coded authenticity stuff is interesting - need to make this feel more natural

### Technical Debt
- wifipumpkin3 linting issues (694 errors!) - but it's external code, so maybe just exclude it?
- Missing mypy and coverage tools
- Some hardcoded paths that could be more flexible

### Next Session Goals
- Populate all the empty/underused folders
- Add developer debugging tools
- Create realistic sample data
- Fix the annoying linting issues where possible
