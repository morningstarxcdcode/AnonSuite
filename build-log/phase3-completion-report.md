## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced CLI Functionality

#### New Anonymity Menu Options
1. **Start AnonSuite (Tor + Proxy)** - Launches multitor with verified configuration
2. **Stop AnonSuite** - Gracefully stops Tor and Privoxy processes
3. **Restart AnonSuite** - Complete service restart with proper timing
4. **Check Status** - Real-time service monitoring and connectivity testing
5. **Monitor Performance** - System resource monitoring during operations
6. **View Tor Logs** - Live log access with last 20 entries

#### Service Integration
```python
# Multitor command construction
cmd = [
    "sudo", multitor_script,
    "--user", "morningstar",
    "--socks-port", "9000",
    "--control-port", "9001", 
    "--proxy", "privoxy"
]
```

#### Status Monitoring
- **Process Detection**: Real PID tracking for Tor and Privoxy
- **Port Verification**: Active listening confirmation on ports 9000, 9001, 8119
- **Connectivity Testing**: Live SOCKS proxy verification with external services
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time monitoring and resource usage

### Network Configuration Verified

#### Active Services
| Service | PID | Port | Function | Status |
|---------|-----|------|----------|--------|
| Tor | 25590 | 9000 (SOCKS) | Anonymity proxy | ✅ RUNNING |
| Tor | 25590 | 9001 (Control) | Tor control interface | ✅ RUNNING |
| Privoxy | 26307 | 8119 (HTTP) | HTTP proxy | ✅ RUNNING |

#### Connectivity Verification
- **Direct Connection**: IP 223.185.33.56 (via Privoxy)
- **Tor Connection**: IP 185.129.61.4 (via Tor SOCKS)
